This collection of notebooks are for my cheat sheet, especially for Tensorflow Deep Leaning.

There are 6 main folders. Each of them develops:
1. classification
2. regression
3. image classification
    - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and transfer learning
4. text classification (NLP)
    - Dense
    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
    - Bi-LSTM
    - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
    - CNN
    - CNN + GRU
5. time series forecasting
    - univariate and multivariate
    - multiple input series and multiple parallel series
    - single-step and multi-step output
    - encoder-decoder Model
    - architectures:
        - Vanilla LSTM
        - Stacked LSTM
        - Bidirectional LSTM
        - CNN LSTM
        - ConvLSTM
6. text generation

Each folder contains the Deep Learning model development from (1) data preparation, (2) model development, and (3) model prediction.
