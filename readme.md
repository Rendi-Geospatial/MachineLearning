This collection of notebooks are for my cheat sheet, especially for Tensorflow Deep Leaning.

There are 4 main folders. Each of them develops:
- image classification
- classification and regression
- text classification (NLP)
- time series forecasting

Each folder contains the Deep Learning model development from (1) data preparation, (2) model development, and (3) model prediction.
